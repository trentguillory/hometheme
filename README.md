# HomeTheme
## Replicating the App Store "Today" Page opening and closing animations

I started this project to further my understanding of animations in SwiftUI. To achieve the animations found here, I had to make use of `GeometryReader`, `PreferenceKey`s, and custom `CoordinateSpace`s. 

While each is relatively straightforward, using them together effectively is a new endeavor for many iOS developers.
